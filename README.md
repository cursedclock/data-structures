# My Data Structures Project
---
My data structures project from my third semester at SBU.
Only uploading this because I had to make a git repo and push something to it for a university assignment and I didn't have anything else.

Using the collections is pretty self-explanatory. (not that you should use them)

**Fun fact:** the sub-trees in this range tree implementation are lazily generated :D
